"""
Central configuration for the league + Club Friendlies live poller.

SCOPE: leagues (config.LEAGUES) and Club Friendlies for those leagues'
clubs (config.FRIENDLIES) only -- no World Cup, no other internationals.
The old standalone World Cup scraper.py has been removed entirely.

ARCHITECTURE:
365Scores is the sole live data source — fixtures discovery, score, status,
and structured events (goal/card/sub) all come from it.

# across seasons -- if a league starts returning 0 games, re-derive the
# id from https://www.365scores.com/football/league/<slug>-<id> and
# update this dict.
#
# `prefix` is used to build each document's matchId, e.g. "epl_4627864",

# PRIORITY-LEAGUE ROLLING WINDOW (legacy -- see SCRAPE_WINDOW_DAYS)
# ============================================================
# Instead of anchoring the scrape window on "now" (a dead zone until the
# priority leagues' seasons actually start), this used to anchor on a
# reference date that starts here and creeps forward by one day per real
# calendar day (see FixtureStore.advance_reference_date_if_needed).
#
# NO LONGER USED by scrape_all_leagues_window() -- leagues now anchor on
# today directly, same as friendlies, per SCRAPE_WINDOW_DAYS above. Left
# in place only because mongo_store.FixtureStore.get_reference_date() /
# advance_reference_date_if_needed() still reference these constants;
# harmless dead weight now that nothing calls those methods from the
# scrape path.

# Shield). Qualifying rounds are excluded regardless of league.

# CLUB FRIENDLIES (EPL / Serie A clubs only) -- leagues_scraper.py

# IMPORTANT: 365Scores does NOT have a separate competitionId per
# parent league for friendlies -- there is no "EPL friendlies" or
# "Serie A friendlies" id to fetch. Every club's friendly worldwide
# (6000+ clubs) is pooled into ONE competition, "Club Friendlies",
# verified live at:
#   https://www.365scores.com/football/league/club-friendlies-321
# If this ever starts returning 0 games, re-derive the id from that
# URL's trailing number, same as the LEAGUES dict above.
FRIENDLIES_COMPETITION_ID = 321

# Because the id above is a single global "everyone's friendlies"
# bucket, leagues_scraper.py fetches it whole and then narrows it down
# to only fixtures where at least one side is a club in these name
# lists (case-insensitive substring match against 365Scores'
# homeCompetitor/awayCompetitor "name" field -- see
# threesixtyfive.filter_games_by_club_names). Several aliases are
# listed per club since 365Scores' display name doesn't always match
# the club's full/common English name (e.g. "Man City" vs "Manchester
# City", "Spurs" vs "Tottenham", "Inter" vs "Internazionale").
#
