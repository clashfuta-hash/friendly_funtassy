"""
365Scores API client for league, friendly, and World Cup/international data.
Fetches: fixtures, live scores, events, lineups, statistics, and commentary.

NOTE: This is the league-scraper's copy of the module and had drifted from
the World Cup poller's copy -- it was missing the shared _fetch_play_by_play_raw
helper and, worse, fetch_commentary() hardcoded "team": None instead of
resolving CompetitorNum the way fetch_match_events() already did. Both are
fixed below by mirroring the World Cup version's structure exactly. The
league-only additions (fetch_games_by_date_range, filter_games_by_club_names)
are kept as-is since the World Cup version doesn't need them.

    that single competition pools every friendly for 6000+ clubs

    mostly-irrelevant payload.

    window only ever returning that day's fixtures. To sidestep that
    quirk entirely rather than depend on whichever way 365Scores
    happens to be behaving, this now issues one request PER DAY in
    [start_date, end_date] (inclusive) via _fetch_games_for_single_date()

    in more than one day's response (shouldn't normally happen, but

# PLAY-BY-PLAY FEED (shared by fetch_commentary and fetch_match_events)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The /web/game/ endpoint does NOT embed commentary or a discrete events
# list directly -- game.commentary and game.events are not real fields.
# It only returns game.playByPlay.feedURL, a pointer to a separate feed
# (pbpgenerator.365scores.com). That feed is the ONLY place 365Scores
# exposes per-event type/minute/side data; the cumulative counters used
# by extract_statistics_from_game() (homeCorners, homeYellowCards, ...)
# have no per-event breakdown.
#
# THIS SHARED HELPER WAS MISSING from the league version of this file --
# fetch_commentary() and fetch_match_events() each duplicated their own
# raw fetch instead of sharing one. Restored to match the World Cup
# version so both functions stay consistent and only need one network
# call's worth of logic to maintain.
#
# Two things the raw feed gets wrong that we correct here:
#   1. The feedURL 365Scores returns comes pre-built with lang=37
#      (Dutch), not English -- every other endpoint in this file uses
#      langId=1, so we force lang=1 here too before fetching.
#   2. Entry field names are PascalCase (.NET-style): Comment, Timeline,
#      Type, TypeName, Period, Title, IsMajor, Players, CompetitorNum --
#      not the lowercase minute/text/type/team/player shape used
#      elsewhere in this codebase.
